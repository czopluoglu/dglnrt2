# Simultaneous estimation of compromised items and examinees with item preknowledge

A repository to develop a model that incorporates both response time and item responses for predicting whether or not an item is compromised and whether or not an examinee has item preknowledge simultaneously.

The model improves upon the ideas laid out in [Shu et al. (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11336-012-9311-3) and [Kasli et al. (2020)](https://psyarxiv.com/bqa3t) and further relaxes the assumption that the set of item compromise status is known.
